# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Bridging the Gap Between Digital Brain and Physical Body

Welcome to the future of AI—where intelligence extends beyond digital screens into the physical world. This comprehensive course introduces you to **Physical AI**: AI systems that operate in reality, understand physical laws, and interact naturally with the world around us.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This course takes you on a journey from foundational concepts to building sophisticated humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions. You'll master:

- **ROS 2**: The nervous system of modern robotics
- **Simulation**: Creating digital twins in Gazebo and Unity
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: AI-powered perception and navigation
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Bridging natural language and robotic control

## 🤖 Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

- **Share our physical form**: Navigate spaces designed for humans
- **Learn from human data**: Abundant training data from human interactions
- **Operate in the real world**: Move beyond digital-only AI systems
- **Understand physical laws**: Gravity, friction, momentum, and more

This represents a **significant transition** from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is organized into 4 comprehensive modules spanning 13 weeks:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Focus**: Middleware for robot control

- ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Python integration with rclpy
- Robot description with URDF
- Building communication pipelines

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Focus**: Physics simulation and environment building

- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions
- High-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs
- Creating realistic test environments

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
**Focus**: Advanced perception and training

- Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM
- Nav2 for path planning
- Synthetic data generation

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Focus**: Convergence of LLMs and robotics

- Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive planning with LLMs
- Natural language command translation
- **Capstone Project**: Autonomous Humanoid
